       "['8. CONCLUSIONS    Finish effects on QFN thermal pad solder joints have been evaluated for QFN packages with different lead finishes including electrolytic Au/electrolytic Pd/electrolytic Ni and immersion Au/electrolytic Pd/electroless Ni, soldered to printed wiring boards with ENIG and ENEPIG plating using eutectic tin-lead solder. In addition, the effect of pre solder tinning of those two surfaces was also evaluated. These results were then used to identify potential finish related mechanisms affecting void formation within the formed solder joints. Both base finish pairings showed poor wetting behavior and resulted in large voids and high % voiding in the QFN thermal pads. In these cases, the finish related mechanism that appears to dominate the high percentage of void formation is large quantities of IMC formation within the bulk solder which likely changed the solder viscosity and inhibited volatile bubble escape from the joint leading to void formation upon solidification. The Pair 2 solder joint, between a QFN with electrolytic Au/electrolytic Pd/electrolytic Ni leads pretinned with solder prior to solder attach to a PWB with ENIG finish yielded significant reduction in voiding by eliminating a majority of the IMC   Proceedings of SMTA International, Sept. 22-26, 2019, Rosemont, IL, USA 758formation within the bulk solder. Lead tinning in the case of immersion Au/electrolytic Pd/electroless Ni to ENEPIG appears to increase the “wetting forces” which oppose void escape from the joint and imply that there may be a wetting threshold associated with QFN thermal pad formation.

       " '5. Sample configuration    The component package used in the current study is an 8 x 8 mm, 54-pin, open-cavity plastic QFN package. Two initial plating configurations are considered: 1) electrolytic Au over electrolytic Pd over electrolytic Ni finish stack up with layer thicknesses of 0.08-0.13 µm, 0.13-0.38 µm, and 2.03 µm minimum, respectively; and 2) immersion Au over electrolytic Pd over electroless Ni finish stack up with layer thicknesses of 0.05-0.13 µm, 0.13-0.38 µm, and 2.03 µm minimum, respectively. The PWB configuration used is a 2.6 mm-thick, 15-layer PWB constructed of controlled dielectric laminates. The PWB thermal pad design consists of a solid 0.05 mm thick Cu pad with a 9 x 9 square grid of 0.18 mm diameter vias non-conductively filled and Cu-capped. Dimpling of plating over the filled vias was limited to less than 0.05 mm. The two PWB finishes assessed were ENIG per IPC-4552 (0.04-0.1 µm Au over NiP over Cu) and ENEPIG per IPC-4556 (>0.030 µm Au over 0.05-0.30 µm Pd over NiP over Cu) [13, 14]. To isolate PWB finish effects, alternate “controlled finish” version of both QFN packages were created by flushing both types of AuPdNi-plated lead surfaces with a 235oC max liquid eutectic Sn-Pb solder wave for a maximum of 30 seconds resulting in similar predominantly Sn-Pb finishes. The soldered surface finish pairings for the component and PWBs evaluated are summarized in Table 2. Table 2. List of component and PWB finish pairings evaluated Pair Component PWB finish 1 electrolytic Au/electrolytic Pd/electrolytic Ni ENIG 2 electrolytic Au/electrolytic Pd/electrolytic Ni - tinned ENIG 3 immersion Au/electrolytic Pd/electroless Ni ENEPIG 4 immersion Au/electrolytic Pd/electroless Ni - tinned ENEPIG  The solder paste used is a halogen free, no clean, type 3 eutectic SnPb solder paste. Solder reflow was achieved using a Vitronics Soltec XPM-730 multi-zone reflow oven with a target reflow temperature of ~215-217oC. No modifications to the ramp rates, heating stage, or reflow duration were attempted to affect the resultant QFN solder joint formation. Voiding of the soldered QFNs was determined using X-ray Proceedings of SMTA International, Sept. 22-26, 2019, Rosemont, IL, USA 754inspection and image analysis. Then the microstructure of assembled QFN solder joints was characterized by microsection analysis using a Hitachi S-3700N variable pressure (VP) scanning electron microscope (SEM) at 15 kV. Each phase composition was characterized using semiquantitative analysis with a Bruker X-flash silicon-based energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector and identification of each was inferred based on existing data on the material systems involved.

       " '3. INTRODUCTION    Over the past two decades, Quad flat, no-lead (QFN) packages have become commonplace in consumer electronics as the demands for lower standoff height, increased compaction, and enhanced thermal performance have remained primary motivators for technology development in the electronics industry [1, 2]. More recently, a subset of the QFN package class, open (or air) cavity QFNs, have appeared more frequently in many high reliability, radio frequency (RF) applications due to their customize-ability and improved performance. This package usually has the same footprint and lead frame geometry as a typical QFN, but rather than the interconnected active device(s) being potted in resin, the component(s) is sealed within an air cavity. This “open” cavity configuration improves upon the potted version by providing a more favorable operating environment for monolithic microwave electronic circuits (MMICs) which operate more efficiently in air. The configuration of a typical open cavity QFN assembled into a circuit card assembly (CCA) can be seen in Figure 1.  Figure 1. Typical open cavity QFN package configuration. Open cavity QFN packages are available in a wide variety of perimeter pin counts and lead finish options. Perimeter pin counts from eight to 100 are found in package sizes from 3x3 mm to 12x12 mm, respectively. Ni-Au and Ni-Pd-Au plating appear to be most common finishing options, but those exist in various plating types (electrolytic, electroless, and immersion) and thickness ranges. For example, a list of the numerous plating options from a single open cavity QFN package supplier is provided below in Table 1. Table 1. Example list of plating options available from one open cavity QFN manufacturer [3] Type Ni (µm) Pd (µm) Au (µm) 1 2.5 - 7.6 - 1.0 – 2.0 2 4.0 - 6.0 0.05 - 0.10 0.30 – 0.50 3 1.27 - 4.6 0.15 – 0.50 0.10 – 0.20 4 0.5 - 2.0 0.02 - 0.15 0.25 – 0.125 4a 0.5 - 2.0 0.02 - 0.15 0.003 – 0.05  While the flexibility these options permit to adapt package selection to the requirements of a specific application or device interconnection method (e.g., wire bonding) is desirable, this variability in finishes can challenge the ability of surface mount assembly (SMT) processes to form robust solder joints at the next level of assembly. For most QFNs, the manifestation of that challenge appears in the form of voids. Since their introduction, void elimination within the large- area, thermal pad solder joint of all QFN types (molded, ceramic, open cavity, etc.) has remained a significant  Proceedings of SMTA International, Sept. 22-26, 2019, Rosemont, IL, USA 753challenge. Concerns regarding their impacts on package reliability as well as on RF and thermal performance have continued to push the desire to minimize individual void sizes and void area percentage [1, 4]. Because the voids are caused primarily by volatile entrapment during solder reflow and solidification, many previous studies have focused on determining the effects resulting from modifications to that process including temperature profile adjustments, solder paste formulation changes, and alternative solder paste printing patterns. Gadepalli, et al. studied the influence of peak reflow temperatures and paste dispense patterns on 16- and 20-pin QFNs with Sn finish soldered to immersion Ag (ImAg) and organic solderability preservative (OSP) finished printed wiring boards (PWBs) on void formation [5]. Zappella et al. proposed the use of vacuum reflow to achieve low voiding large planar joints [6]. Lifton et al. demonstrated changes in void formation caused by solder paste rheology and printing process variations between 52- and 100-pin QFNs to PWBs [7]. Modifications to the PWB footprint have also been considered. Herron et al. found that patterning of solder mask defined pads and thermal via placement significantly impacted void size and area percentage for 68 pin QFNs with Sn finish soldered to a PWB with NiAu finish [8]. The effects of component and PWB finish have received less attention. The Gadepalli study mentioned previously did note differences in void area between the OSP and ImAg finishes evaluated [5]. Bath et al. also conducted a void study on power transistors with 90Sn10Pb coated leads soldered to various PWB finishes (OSP, NiAu, Sn, and SAC305 hot air solder leveling (HASL)); however, the contributions of finish type to differences in voiding were not considered fully [9]. The concept of component and PWB finish affecting QFN voiding in solder joints is not new. Sweatman et al. proposed factors influencing the size of a QFN void including molten solder surface tension and gas pressure present within the void as well as presented examples of void trapping by poor wetting spots on the adjoining surfaces [10]. Other factors potentially can influence solder behavior and ultimately void formation within the QFN thermal pad solder joints. A fundamental aspect of solder joint formation is the formation of intermetallic compounds (IMC) between the solder and surface finishes which can alter the wetting characteristics of the liquid solder [11]. Also, many finish types, like electroless Ni-immersion Au (ENIG), Au-Pd, and electroless Ni-electroless Pd-immersion Au (ENEPIG), have sacrificial preservative layer(s) which dissolve into the molten solder during reflow. Since the solder volume within a QFN joint is limited, those dissolved elements readily achieve compositions where additional IMCs form, like AuSn4 and PdSn3. These IMCs often initially form at the surface but can spall into the liquid solder creating a change in solder viscosity and potentially inhibit the motion of trapped gases attempting to escape [12]. The formation of these other IMCs compounds can also impact the solder joint after formation since they introduce the risk of embrittlement impacting long term reliability. The objective of the current work is to assess the effects of adherent finishes on joint formation and voiding by studying solder joints between PWBs with ENIG and ENEPIG finishes and open-cavity QFN packages with commonly available finish types. The morphology of those formed solder joints will be described and compared to identify finish effects on the observed voiding and any potential risks to long term reliability will be assessed.

       " '1. ABSTRACT    The quad flat no lead (QFN) package connects the integrated circuit (IC) to the printed circuit board (PCB). The exposed copper on the side edges can be a weak point in the long-term reliability of the connection and also lead to the detection of phantom failures in the automated optical inspection (AOI). In order to achieve a 3-dimensional solder connection to the PCB, the preferred approach would be that the solder joint is not only formed between the QFN bottom side and the PCB but also includes the wetting of the QFN flanks. Immersion tin plating offers the possibility to create fully wettable flanks by covering exposed copper at the QFN side walls with a plated tin layer. Nevertheless, there are concerns that immersion plated tin layers might be not enough to pass the shelf-life requirements and heat treatment due to the formation of the Cu/Sn IMC. As the lead frame material differs from the copper substrates as used in standard PCB applications, the immersion tin plating process requires dedicated adjustment. The focus of this study is to investigate the reliability of the immersion tin layers plated by a tailored immersion tin process for QFN flank plating. The tin-plated surface of the QFN flanks is investigated in regard to its soldering performance. This is realized by applying soldering and aging criteria as defined by the target industries. The plating process is tailored to the QFN application and includes specific pretreatment steps to prepare the copper alloy for the immersion tin plating. The properties of the plated immersion tin layers are investigated as well as potential impact of the immersion tin plating process on the electrolytic tin layers covering the QFN top. As tin layers in general are suspected to bear the risk of whisker formation as long as they are not soldered directly, this has been considered in the investigation as well. To tackle this risk, the impact of a whisker mitigating additive is also studied and presented. The soldering performance after different aging conditions is evaluated and correlated to the formation of the intermetallic compound (IMC) after aging. As conclusion it can be stated that the immersion tin coverage of the QFN side flanks allows a enhanced solder wetting and solder joint formation whilst an additionally significant benefit is to enable the possibility of automatic optical inspection.
