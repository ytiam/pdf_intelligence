As could be seen from the curve, the fracture strength of the solder joint was 51.52 MPa, which was very close to the tensile strength of 55.00 MPa of the SAC305 alloy [41]. In this experiment, the gap size of the two Cu bars was 1.01 mm. Zimrich et al. [42] reported that, as the solder gap increased, the fracture strength of the solder joint gradually approached the tensile strength of the solder. Additionally, as could be seen from the curve in Figure 6, the tensile process of the solder joints could be divided into the deformation zone (I) and the crack propagation and ﬁnal fracture zone (II). For both zones, the internal deformation of the material was discussed in Section 3.3. Moreover, the fracture strain of the solder joint reached 19.87%, which was mainly related to the good toughness of the SAC305 alloy [43]. Figure 6.

The flake in region Q1 was perpendicular to the loading ation and propagation for solder joints. 4. Discussion 4.1. Defects Affecting Crack Initiation and Propagation over, when the crack tip stress of the flake crack in region Q1 reached the fracture strength, it was considered that the main causes of the internal defects of solder joints are as follows: ever, the aggregated pores in region Q2 around the IMC layer cracked during loading. axis, while the flake in region Q2 was inside the solder and approximately parallel to the material [10]. Therefore, during the reflow soldering process, a high temperature caused after the surface of the Cu bars was cleaned by solution for cleaning PCB, a small amount solder alloy. However, some gases were not discharged, which resulted in some gases shrinkage pores and flakes might form near the solder surface after the solder solidifies, similar to the crack in the Q1 region in Figure 7a [10]. The position and shape of defects in the solder joints had a significant influence on the solder; and (3) the exhaust of the solder and flux during reflow [18,44]. In this study, remaining in the solder joints to form spherical pores. Many pores were concentrated near During the subsequent propagation process, the propagation rate was significantly higher (1) the additive or organic impurities remaining in the Cu bar; (2) the poor wettability of Defects were inevitable for solder joints [11]. As shown in Figure 2, there were many loading direction. Figure 12a showed the stress distribution around the two flake cracks. Obviously, the stress concentration in region Q1 was greater than that in region Q2. More- the stress distribution. As shown in Figure 2, the pore distribution of the Cu/SAC305/Cu solder joint was very complex.

      "To quantitatively describe the evolution of the internal pores during the tensile process of the Cu/SAC305/Cu solder joints, the defects in three regions (Q1, Q2, and Q3), respec- tively, were extracted as shown in Figure 9. In the Q1 region, two ﬂake defects mainly existed, and were marked as A and B, respectively. Defect A was connected to the outer surface, and defect B was an internal defect. At the initial state, the two defects in region Q1 were separated. When the deformation reached 2.77%, defects A and B connected.

Moreover, there were a few pores that did not completely leave the solder. The the flux, remaining water, and organic material to evaporate, and then left the molten flakes existed inside the solder. The flake in region Q1 was perpendicular to the loading ation and propagation for solder joints. 4. Discussion 4.1. Defects Affecting Crack Initiation and Propagation over, when the crack tip stress of the flake crack in region Q1 reached the fracture strength, it was considered that the main causes of the internal defects of solder joints are as follows: ever, the aggregated pores in region Q2 around the IMC layer cracked during loading. axis, while the flake in region Q2 was inside the solder and approximately parallel to the material [10]. Therefore, during the reflow soldering process, a high temperature caused after the surface of the Cu bars was cleaned by solution for cleaning PCB, a small amount solder alloy. However, some gases were not discharged, which resulted in some gases shrinkage pores and flakes might form near the solder surface after the solder solidifies, similar to the crack in the Q1 region in Figure 7a [10]. The position and shape of defects in the solder joints had a significant influence on the solder; and (3) the exhaust of the solder and flux during reflow [18,44]. In this study, remaining in the solder joints to form spherical pores. Many pores were concentrated near During the subsequent propagation process, the propagation rate was significantly higher (1) the additive or organic impurities remaining in the Cu bar; (2) the poor wettability of Defects were inevitable for solder joints [11]. As shown in Figure 2, there were many loading direction. Figure 12a showed the stress distribution around the two flake cracks. Obviously, the stress concentration in region Q1 was greater than that in region Q2. More- the stress distribution. As shown in Figure 2, the pore distribution of the Cu/SAC305/Cu solder joint was very complex.
