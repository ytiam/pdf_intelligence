During the test, the voltage and current were 150 kV and 67 µA, respectively. The size of the X-ray raw tomography images was 2048 × 2048 pixels. To obtain a clear image of the internal structure of the pores, the specimen was scanned at 180◦, and 501 images were obtained in total. Therefore, the resolution of obtained image was 5.46 µm/pixel. The exposure time of each projection image was approximately 10 s, and the process lasted for approximately 2.5 h. The defect distribution of the Cu/SAC305/Cu solder joint was reconstructed using the VG studio software, as shown in the Figure 2. The different colors of the defects in the Figure 2 indicated the volume of each defect. The geometric shapes of defects were mainly divided into spherical shape and ﬂat shape, which were called spherical pores and ﬂakes, respectively.

Therefore, the experimental test pieces could rotate by 360◦, as shown in Figure 3b, which satisﬁes the scanning requirements of sample structure reconstruction by the µ-CT. The experiment was carried out in an atmospheric environment. In this experi- ment, the displacement loading mode was selected, and the loading rate was 0.03 mm/min. When the test piece was in the pre-load state and the displacement was 0.0279 mm and 0.1359 mm, the experiment was suspended and the X-ray µ-CT process began to work, respectively. The load and displacement of the test piece were recorded by the in situ testing machine.'"

       " '2. ABSTRACT': ' To compare solder joint reliability of automotive electronics, various thermal cycling test conditions for accelerated life test (ALT) are used. ALT conditions of car electronics are different with mounted positions which is divided into engine room, cabin, truck and area of no exposed to direct sunlight. Accordingly, since the degradation level of the solder joint according to the thermal cycle test conditions is different, there is a need to quantitatively compare the degradation of the solder joint according to each ALT condition. Thus, in this study, we conducted various thermal cycling test using by 3216 chip resistors mounted test coupon. 3216 chip resistor mounted test vehicle was soldered with Sn- 3.0Ag-0.5Cu (SAC305, Tamura chemical Co., Japan) solder on 150℃ glass transition temperature (Tg) FR-4 printed circuit board (PCB) using by reflow process in the nitrogen (N2) atmosphere. The in-situ resistance of the chip resistors solder joint was monitored per every one minute at daisy chained loop resistance of the PCB. The failure criteria of the soler joint was over the 1000 Ω. To compare the difference of each acceleration test conditions, we had tested 4 kinds of thermal cycling tests. The 4 ALT conditions in this study were ALT1 (-40~85 ℃, ΔT=125 ℃), ALT2 (-40~115 ℃, Δ T=155 ℃), ALT3 (-40~125 ℃, ΔT=165 ℃) and ALT4 (- 40~150 ℃, ΔT=190 ℃) for 6,500 h. Based on the results, we measured the shear strength of the chip resistor at every 500 h of the four ALT conditions, and its degradation property was compared with test time. And we obtained the failure time caused by chip resistor solder joint, and mean life (50% failure time) and mean-time-to- failure (MTTF) were calculated by Weibull distribution analysis. From those life characteristics, we have quantitatively compared the solder joint degradation level according to each acceleration test conditions with mounted position of the automotive electronics. Those results can lead to shorten the thermal cycling test duration. Key words: Automotive, acceleration factor, car electronics, solder joint, thermal cycling INTRODUCTION Degradation property of the solder joint appears differently depending on the use environment of the product [1-5]. Even for printed wiring board (PWB) manufactured using the same materials and components, the solder joint degradation characteristics of those used in mobile electronic products and those used in automotive electronic products are different. Therefore, the reliability evaluation of the solder joint is tested by different test conditions according to the use environment of the final product [3-6]. Recently, as the electronicization of automobiles accelerates, the use rate of car electronics is rapidly increasing [7]. Automotive electronics have different reliability requirements depending on their installation location in the vehicle. The temperature range of the thermal cycle test is different depending on the installation location of the cabin, engine room, trunk, etc. When there is a change in parts, material, or design used in a car electronics, reliability evaluation must be performed again to confirm product performance and safety. Car electronics suppliers have concerns about the prolongation of test time through such retesting, and to solve this problem, some companies want to shorten the reliability test time through accelerated testing. For example, cabin electronics supplier wants to shorten the test time using by engine room electronics test condition instead of cabin electronics test condition. However, it is not clear how much the test time should be reduced because the acceleration factor for the test conditions of the cabin and the engine room electrics is not clear. Therefore, in this study, after manufacturing a test vehicle soldered with 3216 chip resistor, a thermal cycle test was conducted under four kinds of test conditions. The test coupon was a FR-4 printed circuit board (PCB) with a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 150 ° C and a 3216 chip resistor. Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu (SAC305) solder was used for preparing the test vehicle, and reflow soldering process was performed under the nitrogen atmosphere. The test vehicle was configured to be connected in a daisy chain to enable real-time resistance measurement, and the resistance was measured in real-time every one minute for the solder joints of all chip resistors. Based on these experimental results, we have derived the mean life and B10 life of R3216 solder joints with each acceleration test condition under thermal cycling, and the mean life between each test was compared to present a correlation for acceleration effect.

       " '3. EXPERIMETNAL PROCEDURE': ' Printed circuit board (PCB), Solder materials, and Chip Components The test coupon sample was prepared with Tg=150 ℃, FR-4 PCB soldered with 3216 chip resistor which was 100 Ω ±1% the rated resistance and Ni/Sn plated. The test vehicle was composed of 5 groups as shown in Figure 1, and each group Proceedings of the SMTA Electronics in Harsh Environments Conference 2023 50was made so that twenty 3216 chip resistors are connected in a daisy chain.  Figure 1. Photograph of (a) 3216 chip resistor test vehicle and (b,c) each group and daisy chained circuit design The test vehicle was manufactured at a peak temperature of 244 ℃ using a reflow soldering process. After soldering, as shown in Figure 2, it was confirmed that the void content of the solder joint was within the maximum of 7% through X- ray non-destructive analysis.  Figure 2. X-ray non-destructive analysis result of 3216 chip resistor solder joints Thermal Cycling Test Conditions To compare the difference of each acceleration test conditions, we had tested 4 kinds of thermal cycling tests. The 4 ALT conditions in this study were ALT1 (-40-85 ℃, ΔT=125 ℃), ALT2 (-40-115 ℃, ΔT=155 ℃), ALT3 (-40- 125 ℃, ΔT=165 ℃) and ALT4 (-40-150 ℃, ΔT=190 ℃) for 6,500 h as shown in Figure 3. Failure Criteria 5 Groups were considered to each 5 components. 20 chip resistors in the one Group was connected with the daisy chain. The in-situ resistance of the chip resistors solder joint was monitored per every one minute at the daisy chained loop resistance of the PCB. The failure criteria of the chip resistors soler joint was over the 1000 Ω. The in-situ resistance of the chip resistors solder joint was monitored per every one minute at daisy chained loop resistance of the PCB. The failure criteria of the solder joint was over the 1000 Ω. Figure 4 shown the in-situ monitoring results of 3216 chip resistor solder joints. From these data, we obtained the solder joint failure time of each thermal cycling test conditions.   Figure 3.

Solder joints resistance monitoring results with various thermal cycling condition: (a) ALT1, (b) ALT2, (c) ALT3 and (d) ALT4 Shear Strength Measurement We also measured the shear strength of the chip resistor at every 500 h of the four ALT conditions, and its degradation property was compared with test time. Shear strength measurement condition was that shear tool height and speed were 50 ㎛ and 167 ㎛/s. ',\n",
       " '4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION': ' Comparison of Shear Strength Degradation with thermal cycling conditions Figrue 5 shows the degradaion rate comparison result of 3216 chip resistor solder joints with thermal cycling test conditions. If we compared to ALT3 and ALT4, the degradation rate of ALT4 was 2.2 times and 1.8 times faster than that of ALT 3 at 1000 and 1500 cycles, respectively. <image: DeviceRGB, width: 734, height: 416, bpc: 8> <image: DeviceRGB, width: 738, height: 275, bpc: 8> <image: DeviceRGB, width: 752, height: 373, bpc: 8> <image: DeviceRGB, width: 710, height: 602, bpc: 8> Proceedings of the SMTA Electronics in Harsh Environments Conference 2023 51 Figure 5. Degradation rate comparison of R3216 solder joints with thermal cycling conditions Weibull Distribution Analysis As a result of 4 types of ALT tests for 6500 cycles, the failure occurrence time was obtained from each test condition, and based on this, a Weibull distribution analysis was performed as shown in Figure 6. From the results of these Weibull distributions, the mean life and B10 life according to the accelerated test conditions were derived.  Figure 6. Weibull distribution analysis results after 4 kinds of acceleration life tests under thermal cycling of 3216 chip resistor solder joints: (a) ALT1, (b) ALT2, (c) ALT3 and (d)ALT4 Table 1 shows the mean life expectancy derived from each ALT test. These mean life is be considered as the mean-time- to-failure (MTTF). Comparing the mean lifetime for R3216 solder joint, ALT1 had ΔT=125 ℃ and the lifetime was 5812 cycles, ALT2 showed ΔT=155 ℃, 2260 cycles, ALT3 showed ΔT=165 ℃, 2025 cycles, and ALT4 showed ΔT=190 ℃ and the lifetime was 736 cycles. As the ΔT between the high and low temperature of the thermal cycling condition increased, the mean life of solder joint was decreased. The reason why the solder joint strength rapidly decreased as the test conditions were severe was due to cracks occurring at the solder joint as shown in Figure 7. This was because crack generation due to thermo-mechanical fatigue caused by repeated thermal fatigue during the ALT test act as the main cause of solder joint degradation [1-3,7]. Table 1. Mean life of R3216 solder joint with thermal cycling test conditions Life ALT1 ALT2 ALT3 ALT4 Mean Life (Cycles) 5812.6 2260.6 2025.7 735.9   Figure 7. Optical micrographs of R3216 solder joint after 1500 thermal cycling test of ALT2 condition Compare to Acceleration Effect with Thermal Cycling Conditions Based on the mean life (or MTTF) and B10 lifetime of each ALT condition in Table 1, the acceleration between each test condition was compared. Acceleration between tests can be calculated based on an acceleration model, and can also be calculated as an arithmetic ratio of each derived life. As a result of calculating the mean life ratio from the actual test results, the ALT3 and ALT4 conditions showed an acceleration of about 2.8 times the degradation of the solder joint strength. This was found to be similar to 2.2 times when the actually measured bonding strength degradation rate was calculated. Finally, it was found that the acceleration between the ALT test conditions based on the ratio of the degradation level of the solder joint strength and the mean life derived from the Weibull statistical analysis showed similar values. Therefore, we have known that the thermal cycling test time can be <image: DeviceRGB, width: 731, height: 442, bpc: 8> <image: DeviceRGB, width: 791, height: 829, bpc: 8> <image: DeviceRGB, width: 370, height: 309, bpc: 8> Proceedings of the SMTA Electronics in Harsh Environments Conference 2023 52reduced by more than 50% when the cabin electronics are tested under the engine room test condition. ',\n",
       " '5. CONCLUSIONS': ' Four kinds of accelerated tests were performed for 6500 cycles on automotive electronics, and the bonding strength degradation rate of 3216 chip resistor solder joints was measured from each test condition. And also, the mean life (or MTTF) was derived from the Weibull distribution analysis results based on the in-situ measured resistance of the 3216 chip resistor solder joints. Based on these solder joint strength degradation rates and mean life, the acceleration factors of four ALT tests were calculated. From these results, we have found that the engine room electronics test condition was about 2.2-2.8 times more severe than the cabin electronics test condition. ',\n",
